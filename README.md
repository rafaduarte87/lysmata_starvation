**Abstract**: We experimentally assessed the effects of different feeding regimes on newly hatched larvae of the shrimp _Lysmata seticaudata_ using a range of biomarkers of oxidative stress and antioxidant response. We showed that starving newly hatched larvae promoted short-term stress responses at the subsequent larval stage, particularly by increasing the activity of oxidative stress enzymes and the total antioxidant capacity of larvae. Such a brief starvation period at the beginning of larval development had significant long-term effects, delaying the time of metamorphosis to post-larvae and resulting in the metamorphosis of larger shrimp.
